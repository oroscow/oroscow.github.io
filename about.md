I finished my B.Sc. at Vancouver Island University (Nanaimo, BC) with a high GPA and in my final year I took on an undergraduate thesis project that was based upon investigating the differential effects of a lesser-known viral inhibitor on reoviruses in different genera. This was when I knew that I wanted to pursue research.

I began my M.Sc. under the guidance of Dr. Baozhong Meng in the University of Guelph (Guelph, ON). Over the course of my studies, I constructed a full-length infectious clone of an uncharacterised grapevine virus and observed its ability to express proteins in model plants. During this time, I also became familiar with bioinformatics and computational methods for analysing genomic data.

My interest in expanding into protein work led me to apply for the position of lab manager/research technician for Dr. Wei Zhang. I have been in charge of conducting phage display selections, optimising SPR experiments for assessing protein-protein binding, purifying proteins, and general lab management. Primarily, I focused on using phage display to select for novel binders of cancer-implicated E3 ligases and deubiquitinases with the aim of modulating their activities and altering patterns of post-translational modification.

I am currently interested in biochemistry/biophysics and how these influence structural dynamics and activities of macromolecules.
