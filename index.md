## Projects & Goals

* Integrate wet lab and bioninformatic techniques in order to speed up data analysis and reduce likelihood of error.
* Develop tools that help lab members and potentially others.
* Advance personal skills in both the lab and outside.
* Currently working on seemless phage display analysis from raw sequencing data to fully analysed outputs.
